description = This improoved core have of built-in reaction wheel module, based on rotation wheels from old grill. Also it can not only function as a satellite or probe base, but as the perfect outdoor grill too. And if anyone asks during the new annual KSC Barbecue, why disappears the wheels of second grill, I believe, we understood us. Space conquer is more important!
