Backyard rocket parts
After serious budget cuts at the Kerbal Space Agency, they turn to the one contractor they can still afford: Bargain Rocket Parts Inc.

Features:

- 34 brand new parts, mostly fashioned out of duct tape, cardboard, and whatever else we could find laying around for optimum cost-efficiency.

- Full IVA for the BC-1 Space Box command module.

- Tech-tree integration (using ModuleManager).

- Includes four new science experiments.
