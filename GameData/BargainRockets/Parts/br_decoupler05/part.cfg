description = We were trying to invent a new decoupler system using compressed air, but we were having trouble finding a good storage tank for compressed air. Then one of our engineers frustratedly said, "There's proven mechanics already for decouplers; why re-invent the wheel?" We re-considered after his comment, but then we simply couldn't get our minds off of wheels.
